\section{Introduction}
Biomedical computing plays a significant role in decisions support and classification. The project aims to use EEG data to develop a model to classify emotions. The final result classifies the emotion state and visualizes the brain activity of a participant. 

The report is divided as follows: \\ The Description section describes the data used in the project. The Methods section focuses on the algorithmic details and explains the methodology and any equations or figures used in the project. It is followed by the Results section which illustrates all the qualitative and quantitative results of this project. Then, Accomplishments sections talks about the accomplishments as well as obstacles experienced during the implementation. Contribution section lists all the contributions of each group members. Conclusion and Discussions provides a summary and analyzes and discusses. certain aspects of the project. At the end, Future Work section discusses possible improvements and other work that can be done in this project.


\section{Description}
The project uses EEG datasets from BCMI (Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence). The model used SEED IV dataset for training, which includes data from 16 participants. Each participant participated in 3 sessions where each session had 24 trials. In each trial, participants watched one of the film clips as stimulus materials to induce specific emotional state. There are 4 categories of emotions induced by clips: happy, sad, neutral and fear. During each trial, EEG signals and eye movements were collected with a 62-channel ESI NeuroScan System and SMI eye-tracking glasses. 

The EEG signals are downsampled to a 200 Hz sampling rate and processed with a bandpass filter between 1 Hz and 75 Hz to remove noise and artifacts. Differential entropy (DE) features were extracted from the EEG signals.
\[DE = \int P(x) ln(P(x)) dx\]

Eye movement features, such as pupil diameter, fixation, saccade, and blink, were also extracted from the eye-tracking data.

\section{Methods}
The proposed method is to classify EEG data into emotion state using Machine Learning. The dataset provides the extracted features from raw EEG data. The model is trained on these extracted features and classifies the emotion state using a new EEG data.

Training Model:
\\ The model is trained using SEED-IV dataset containing EEG features for three different sessions. Differential Entropy (DE) features are extracted using the de\_LDS data from each .mat file. The data is reshaped and labels are assigned to the features based on the session number. The data is split into training and testing set using 33\% of the data for testing. The model is trained using Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) and the features are normalized using StandardScaler.

Testing Model:
\\ The model is tested using EEG data from SEED-V dataset. The dataset contains the DE features of 16 participants. Due to the inconsistency in the number of emotion labels in training and testing datasets, label 0 is skipped while loading the SEED-V dataset. The emotion labels in SEED-V are mapped to the labels used by the model. The models predicts the labels for SEED-V datasets and calculates the accuracy.

File Read:
\\ The file read module is helps in reading and processing the data from files of .mat and .npz format. 
\\ read\_mat() function: This function opens a file manager window to ask the user to select a file of .mat format. The data is loaded from the file as a dictionary using scipy.io.loadmat. 
\\ read\_npz() function: This function opens a file manager window to ask the user to select a file of .npz format. The data is loaded from the file using numpy.load.
\\ read\_all() function: This function loads data from both .mat and .npz file formats.
